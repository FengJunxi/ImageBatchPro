This is an image batch processing software for porous media, including commonly used functions:

- porosity calculation (2D and 3D)
- several statistical functions (2D  and 3D)
- local porosity distribution (2D and 3D)
- image  transformation (resize, crop,segmentation)
- image format conversion
- image shuffle 
- sampling ratio calculation 
- mathematical morphology (dilation, erosion, close, open)
- choosing training image 
- image uniting for creating image data
